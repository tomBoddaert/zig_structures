# `zig_structures`

This is an implementation of some data structures that I wrote to help me learn Zig.

## Adding `zig_structures` to your project
Run
```sh
zig fetch --save https://github.com/tomBoddaert/zig_structures/archive/{commit}.tar.gz
```
Where `{commit}` is replaced with the commit hash.

## Documentation
To build the documentation, clone the repository and run
```sh
zig build docs
```
